"""Walk every relative link in the INSTALLED documentation and fail on a break.

Why this exists
---------------
Stage 2 added `docker/` and `examples/` to the install rules because the
installed documentation links into them: README.md, README.ja.md,
docs/README.md, docs/en/README.md and both language versions of
docs/ablation_and_matched_evaluation.md carry 12 relative links to
docker/nav2/README.md and examples/gazebo/README.md, and before those two
rules none of the 12 resolved under share/<package>. Nothing but a comment in
CMakeLists.txt held that coupling: drop an install rule and the links go quiet.
This makes the coupling a test.

WHY NOT ctest. It needs an install tree, and there is none to walk in the
plain-CMake build: every install() rule in CMakeLists.txt sits inside
`if(ament_cmake_FOUND)`, ament_cmake_DIR is NOTFOUND in a host build, and
`cmake --install build_host --prefix ...` was measured to write zero files. In
the container ctest already runs 11 tests against a build tree, not an install
tree. So this runs from docker/nav2/test_package.sh, after colcon has
installed, against the real prefix.

docs/reviews/ IS EXCLUDED, on purpose and not to make a number look good.
Those 72 links point at src/, test/ and a sibling repository by design - the
review records cite the code they reviewed - and no install rule can make them
resolve under share/<package>. Excluding them is a decision about what install
rules can defend, not a way of hiding a break: the count of what was skipped is
printed, and a break anywhere else is still a failure. (Measured on the
installed tree: 393 relative link targets, 72 broken, all 72 under
docs/reviews/, 0 broken outside it.)

# `[text](target)` and `![text](target)`, with an optional "title" after the

#
# MARKDOWN ONLY, and that is a limit of the checker, not a property of the
# tree. A reStructuredText link, `text <target>`_, CANNOT be matched by this
# expression at all - it is not that none happens to be present. The walk
# opens .rst files, so a future .rst relative link would be read and silently
# not checked. Measured today: the only installed .rst is CHANGELOG.rst and it
# carries no relative link in either form, so the gap costs nothing yet. Add a
# second pattern here before that changes.
