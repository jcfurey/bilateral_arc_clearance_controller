Forthcoming
-----------
* Build and test on ROS 2 Lyrical (Nav2 1.5) alongside ROS 2 Jazzy (Nav2
  1.3). Nav2 1.5 changed the ``nav2_core::Controller`` interface - the parent
  node is a ``nav2::LifecycleNode``, ``setPlan()`` became
  ``newPathReceived()``, and ``computeVelocityCommands()`` also receives the
  controller server's transformed plan and the goal - and the plugin now
  implements both, selected at build time from the installed ``nav2_core``
  version (``BAC_NAV2_API`` overrides the detection). The plan handling is the
  same under both: the plugin keeps the raw global plan, transforms it through
  TF and prunes it to ``max_range`` itself, and does not consume the path
  handler's plan; the Nav2 integration guide states why. ROS 2 Kilted (Nav2
  1.4) shares the Jazzy interface and is expected to build, but is not part of
  CI.
* Link ROS dependencies as the CMake targets their packages export instead of
  through ``ament_target_dependencies()``, which is deprecated from Kilted and
  no longer defined by ``find_package(ament_cmake)`` in Lyrical. Include the
  ``.hpp`` tf2 headers; the ``.h`` ones are gone in Lyrical. Declare ``tf2_ros``
  and, on distributions that ship it, ``nav2_ros_common`` in the manifest.
* Generalise the Docker verification harness from ``docker/nav2-jazzy`` to
  ``docker/nav2``, taking the ROS 2 distribution as an argument (Lyrical by
  default, ``jazzy`` on request), and run the hosted CI's ROS job on both. The
  harness additionally starts the installed ``bac_filter.launch.py`` on the
  distribution's Python (3.14 on Lyrical). Both the harness image and the CI
  job upgrade the base image's packages to the current packages.ros.org sync
  before resolving the manifest: the image is rebuilt less often than the
  repository is synced, and across a sync that changes generated typesupport
  code the image's ``std_msgs`` no longer links with a freshly installed
  dependency (every ROS test binary failed to load on Lyrical).
* Generalise the DIRECTION OF TRAVEL through the whole controller, not just the
  geometry. The candidate stopping test, the contact horizon, the braking
  margin, the emergency zone and its escape gate, and the deceleration ramp all
  computed from the forward component alone, so a purely lateral command was
  admitted with zero braking distance, measured against ``safety_margin.front``
  instead of ``.side``, classified as stationary by the emergency layer, and
  could be reversed outright by the deceleration sign. Each is now computed on
  the velocity vector. ``withLinearSpeed`` takes a non-negative SPEED and the
  model recovers the direction, rather than the caller deriving a sign from the
  forward component. Differential drive and Ackermann are unaffected: every one
  of these reduces to the previous expression when ``vy`` is zero, and their
  outputs stay byte-identical.
* Add a holonomic (omnidirectional) motion model, ``motion_model.type: omni``.
  Lateral velocity is the avoidance dimension, not yaw rate: the candidate
  lattice is forward speed x lateral speed - two dimensions, like the
  differential-drive forward speed x yaw rate lattice, but not the same number
  of candidates (measured with the shipped holonomic configuration from a
  current velocity of 0.20 m/s: 96 against 130 on the COARSE lattice, i.e.
  with ``w_refine_steps`` set to 0; this configuration does not set it and the
  ``bac_core.hpp`` default of 3 adds 2 x 3 refinement candidates, giving
  102 against 136). The yaw rate regulates
  the body onto the local path tangent and is fixed before candidate
  generation, so the trajectory that is scored and contact-checked is the one
  that is driven. In a passage the regulator also points the body into the gap
  rather than crabbing towards it, because a crabbing rectangle sweeps wider
  than a straight one. Requires a positive ``limits.vy_max`` and sensor
  coverage abeam the body, and it publishes ``cmd_vel.linear.y``, which the
  downstream base controller must honour.
* Honour the goal ORIENTATION Nav2 carries on the last plan pose. The adapter
  transforms it into the base frame and ``BacCore::process`` takes it as an
  optional argument; the pose reference fades from the path tangent to the goal
  orientation over the last 1.5 m and is fully governed by it within 0.5 m.
  Only the holonomic model can act on it - a model that steers with yaw cannot
  choose its orientation independently of its direction of travel - so
  differential drive and Ackermann ignore it and follow the path tangent
  exactly as before. Measured yaw error over goal orientations 0.0, -1.2, 1.5,
  2.5, -2.8 and 3.0 rad, at ``heading_gain`` 1.5 with the goal at (4, 2), is
  0.006-0.060 rad, inside the 0.25 rad ``yaw_goal_tolerance`` that Nav2's
  ``SimpleGoalChecker`` defaults to; the differential-drive reference spans
  0.541-2.943 rad over the same set.
* Generalise the swept-trajectory evaluator from "velocity is along body +x" to
  an arbitrary constant body twist. The centre of rotation moves from
  ``(0, v / w)`` to ``(-vy / w, v / w)`` and the footprint's leading, trailing
  and lateral extents become support functions of the direction of travel.
  Substituting ``vy = 0`` reproduces the previous closed forms exactly, so
  differential drive and Ackermann run the generalised code with byte-identical
  output rather than a preserved special case.
* ``Twist2D`` gains a ``vy`` field defaulting to zero, and the scorer and output
  stage carry a full body twist instead of a ``(v, w)`` scalar pair. Every
  non-holonomic model produces and consumes ``vy == 0``.
* Add deterministic holonomic unit and closed-loop regression tests plus an
  installable holonomic Nav2 configuration.
* Add an Ackermann motion model that samples body curvature within
  ``turn_radius_min``, never offers in-place rotation, and preserves the Nav2
  forward-speed/yaw-rate command contract. The vehicle model is described at
  the granularity of the Nav2 MPPI ``AckermannConstraints``; road-wheel
  kinematics belong to the downstream vehicle controller.
* Add deterministic Ackermann unit and closed-loop regression tests plus an
  installable Ackermann Nav2 configuration.
* Change the differential-drive output reachability stage, which every
  existing differential-drive user receives. When the one-cycle yaw limit
  changes the selected command and the clamped arc can then no longer stop
  before contact, the command is decelerated along its own curvature and the
  yaw limit and contact test are reapplied (up to eight times), instead of
  holding the yaw rate and lowering the speed once. A command that never
  becomes admissible brakes translation and retains only a reachable in-place
  rotation that is itself admissible. Measured per tick against the previous
  implementation with synchronised state on the shipped ``diff_drive``
  configuration, 1014 of 200000 sampled ticks differ (0.5070%); every observed
  difference is conservative (stop, drive slower, or give up the rotation). In
  closed loop, 9 of 10 worlds are bit-identical and the tenth deviates by at
  most 2 mm. ``test/output_stage_unit.cpp`` pins the new semantics.
* Do not apply the output deadband when applying it would make the published
  twist unable to stop before contact. The deadband runs after every
  admissibility check, so zeroing a yaw rate below ``angvel_min`` could publish
  a straightened arc nobody had checked; the command as selected is published
  instead. This reaches DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE as well, and unlike the output-stage
  change above the difference is not a reduction - the published yaw rate can
  be non-zero where the previous revision published zero. **It does differ at
  the shipped ``angvel_min`` of 0.01 rad/s** - how often depends entirely on
  the tick generator, so every generator is stated. Measured against ``main``
  (2488248) with identical randomised differential-drive tick streams fed to
  both revisions and the outputs compared row by row, all at the shipped
  ``angvel_min``, 400000 ticks each, seed 12345 except where the table says a
  second seed (987654321); the branch-reach column comes from a scratch copy of
  ``bac_core.cpp`` with a counter in the branch. The generators are described
  by shape rather than shipped, so these counts are not reproducible verbatim
  from this file alone - what IS reproducible is the qualitative result, that
  drawing the current yaw rate from the band below reaches the branch and
  drawing it uniformly over a wide range mostly does not:

  ::

      drawn from +-[0.085, 0.124] rad/s              19559     182     193
    the same, second seed                            19624     190     192

      current w uniform +-1 rad/s                     3033       1       1

  Reaching the branch needs the yaw rate ALONE to be rounded away while the
  speed survives, and that needs the current yaw rate to sit in a narrow band
  just below one control period of yaw authority
  (``acc_w * control_period`` = 0.125 rad/s), where
  ``limitReachableCommand`` leaves a residual of a few thousandths - or where
  the curvature-preserving slowdown produces one. Over the 397 branch reaches
  recorded above, ``|current.w|`` lay in [0.0863, 0.1301] rad/s without
  exception, and 370 of the 397 were at 0.10 rad/s or above. The same corridor
  generator run for 100000 ticks reaches the branch 43 times when the current yaw rate is
  drawn from that band, 3 times when it is drawn uniformly over +-1 rad/s, and
  0 times when it is drawn over +-0.03 rad/s.

  A measurement of "0" here therefore means the generator under-sampled that
  band, not that the behaviour is unchanged (R19 M9). The last row above is the
  generator an earlier revision of this entry used, and at 40000 ticks it does
  give 0 branch reaches and 0 differing rows (the deadband still changes the
  command 297 times); at 400000 ticks the same generator reaches the branch
  once. Do not read "0 rows differ at the shipped ``angvel_min``" as a property
  of the change. Rows can also differ slightly more often than the branch is
  reached (193 against 182 above) because the core is stateful across ticks, so
  one suppressed rounding perturbs later ticks. Every shipped regression
  fixture, including the 17-scenario harness and the Ackermann suite, is
  byte-identical either way.
  Note that ``angvel_min`` is applied by the holonomic model too, not only by
  differential drive.
* Bind the motion model once per configuration instead of per control tick, so
  an unusable kinematic configuration is rejected by ``setParams`` and
  ``process`` neither allocates nor throws.
* Validate a motion-model configuration before committing it. A rejected
  ``setParams`` previously left the surviving model reading the rejected
  parameters, where a non-positive ``turn_radius_min`` turned the Ackermann
  steering clamp into a full-lock command instead of a clean failure.
* Differential drive no longer emits an in-place rotation that was never
  checked for admissibility when the output stage brakes to zero speed. Such a
  tick now reports ``STOP`` rather than ``AVOIDING``; subscribers of
  ``avoid_status`` may observe the changed value. This is the largest class of
  the output-stage difference measured above (977 of the 1014 differing
  ticks). The 17-scenario harness output is unchanged.
* Extract differential-drive candidate generation, constant-command rollout,
  and in-place rotation policy from ``BacCore`` as a motion-model boundary.
* Extract constant-curvature bilateral-clearance and exact swept-footprint
  evaluation so it can be reused by future non-differential-drive policies.
* Add focused regression tests for the differential-drive motion-model seam.
* Add a reproducible ROS 2 Jazzy/Nav2 Docker build that verifies the complete
  controller plugin and ROS adapter tests without writing into the checkout.
