 * @date 2026-08-26
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2026 Masaaki Hijikata
 *
 * Algorithm summary (details and rationale in the package README):
 *  1. Emergency stop if any point is inside the body + braking distance zone,
 *     inflated by the safety margins with rounded (elliptical) corners.
 *  2. Ask the configured motion model for candidates: v inside the
 *     acceleration-limited translational window crossed with yaw rate
 *     (differential drive, plus a v=0 rotation row) or with body curvature
 *     bounded by turn_radius_min (Ackermann, never a rotation row), plus the
 *     stop candidate. Roll each out as a constant-curvature arc.
 *  3. Admissibility: discard candidates that cannot stop before the first
 *     body hit on their arc (and rotations that sweep into an obstacle).
 *  4. Score = saturated bilateral clearance + local-goal following (distance /
 *     heading) - hysteresis - lateral squeeze; output the best.
