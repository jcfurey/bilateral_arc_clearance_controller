/**
 * Largest projection of the footprint rectangle onto the direction `(dx, dy)`
 * - the rectangle's support function. For `(1, 0)` this is `front`, for
 * `(-1, 0)` it is `-rear`, and for `(0, 1)` it is `width / 2`, so a
 * non-holonomic command reproduces the front/rear/half-width extents exactly.
 *
 * Shared by the swept-arc frame and by the emergency governor's slab test:
 * both need the body's extent along an arbitrary direction of travel, and
 * they are required to agree.
 *
 * Build-flag note. The governor used to hold its own inline copy of this
 * expression, which the compiler was free to contract into an FMA; a call
 * across a translation unit is not contracted the same way. Under the flags
 * this package actually ships (`Release`, i.e. `-O3 -DNDEBUG`, with no
 * `-march`, which is what CMakeLists and the Nav2 containers both use) the
 * outputs are bit-identical to the pre-sharing code - 1,296,000 random ticks
 * across the three models, zero differences. Adding `-march=native` breaks
 * that tie, for the HOLONOMIC model only: 648 of 240,000 ticks move, by at
 * most 2.1e-6 m/s in `v` and 1.3e-5 m/s in `vy`, with `status`,
 * `admissible_count` and `candidate_count` never changing. Differential drive
 * and Ackermann stay bit-identical even then. The "bit-identical" claim for
 * this refactor is therefore conditional on the build flags, and it holds for
 * what is shipped.
