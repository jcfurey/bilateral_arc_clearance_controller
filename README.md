# bilateral_arc_clearance_controller

English | [日本語](README.ja.md)

Bilateral Arc Clearance (BAC) is a Nav2 local controller for differential-drive, Ackermann, and holonomic robots. It evaluates the
free space remaining on the left and right sides of candidate arcs. Building on DWA-style velocity candidates
and stopping admissibility, BAC balances observed bilateral clearance in narrow openings and gives global-path
tracking priority in open space.

![BAC candidate-arc and bilateral-clearance geometry](docs/images/bac_geometry.svg)

The package provides three components:

- `bac::BacCore`: a ROS-independent C++17 algorithm
- `bac::BacController`: a Nav2 `nav2_core::Controller` plugin, built and tested on ROS 2 Lyrical (Nav2 1.5) and Jazzy (Nav2 1.3)
- `bac_filter_node`: an evaluation and legacy-integration node that reshapes an existing `cmd_vel` using raw scans

The package is licensed under MIT and is currently version 0.1.0.

## Purpose and scope of claims

BAC evaluates robot-frame observations on every control cycle instead of leaving obstacle response entirely to
a path represented in the map frame. Compared with an architecture that periodically updates a global path from
a single pose estimate, BAC is intended to **reduce sensitivity to lateral map–odom error and replanning delay**.

This is not a safety guarantee independent of upstream state. The following assumptions must hold:

- obstacle-sensor coverage, freshness, and extrinsics are adequate for the application;
- TF can transform the plan into the base frame, and current velocity is available;
- the footprint, control period, and braking capability conservatively represent the physical robot;
- the downstream velocity controller enforces velocity and acceleration limits; and
- obstacles can be treated as static points within one control cycle.

While a raw scan is valid, obstacle geometry and bilateral clearance do not directly depend on map–odom error.
However, path-tracking terms still depend on the transformed plan, and the costmap fallback used after a scan
failure again depends on the costmap and TF. The claim is therefore **reduced sensitivity within the stated
assumptions and evaluation range**, not invariance to arbitrary upstream failures. See
[Algorithm and claim boundaries](docs/en/algorithm.md) for the distinction between algorithmic rules,
observations, and non-guarantees.

## Evaluation results

A published matched-condition benchmark is currently available only for the differential-drive model. Ackermann
coverage is limited to the deterministic unit checks and closed-loop regressions described below.

A matched-condition benchmark used ROS 2 Jazzy with a common robot footprint, NavFn, 1 Hz replanning, worlds,
10 Hz local-costmap input, forward-only controller candidates, a common 0.4 m/s forward cap, and common
actuator acceleration limits. The shared Nav2 recovery tree still includes `BackUp`, so the complete system is not forward-only. It contains
18 scenarios × 3 runs × 4 controllers = 216 episodes. Controller-specific trajectory generation, horizons,
critics, and tuning necessarily remain different.

| Controller | Successes | Collisions | Mean on successful runs | Median | Worst minimum clearance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BAC (matched) | 54/54 | 0 | 29.7 s | 28.4 s | 0.078 m |
| DWB | 48/54 | 2 | 24.6 s | 25.2 s | 0.000 m |
| MPPI (matched) | 51/54 | 0 | 27.9 s | 27.3 s | 0.049 m |
| RPP | 48/54 | 0 | 24.2 s | 24.8 s | 0.016 m |

BAC completed all matched episodes, including 3/3 in an appearing-obstacle case where the other configurations
did not complete, and 3/3 in a 1.5 m corridor with a synthetic 0.25 m lateral localization offset. However, BAC
was markedly slower and had less clearance in the zigzag cases, and one clutter run stalled for 82.8 s before
eventually completing. A separate 216-episode BAC ablation found the clearest effect from removing the bilateral
balance term: in the extreme offset corridor, mean time changed from 29.2 to 42.4 s, clearance from 0.227 to
0.174 m, and mean lateral error from 0.028 to 0.053 m. All ablation variants still completed 54/54, and the
reverse-escape contribution was not identified because baseline BAC never selected reverse in that set.

These are limited deterministic simulation observations, not independent success-probability estimates,
physical-robot safety evidence, or proof of general superiority. See the
[matched comparison and ablation report](docs/en/ablation_and_matched_evaluation.md) and
[method comparison](docs/en/method_comparison.md) for conditions, limitations, earlier feature-enabled results,
and design differences from existing controllers.

### Visual evidence

[Download the higher-quality 25.5 s side-by-side MP4](docs/media/bac_vs_dwb_matched_appearing_obstacle.mp4).
The inline GIF synchronously replays run 1 of the matched `appearing_obstacle` benchmark at 2x speed: BAC
completed the run, while DWB eventually aborted. The annotation also reports the three-repeat result (BAC 3/3,
DWB 0/3). This is a replay of stored deterministic 2D ray-cast traces—not Gazebo footage—and its
[input/output hashes](docs/media/bac_vs_dwb_matched_appearing_obstacle_evidence.json) accompany it.

![BAC demonstrating adaptive clearance in Gazebo](docs/media/bac_gazebo_adaptive_clearance_preview.gif)

[Download the higher-quality 35.2 s Gazebo MP4](docs/media/bac_gazebo_adaptive_clearance.mp4). In the continuous
left-to-right take shown by the inline GIF, BAC keeps 0.31 m of physical-body clearance from a static offset
obstacle while detouring by 0.80 m, returns to within 0.30 m of the centerline in 8.3 s, and passes through a
1.0 m gate with its center within 0.013 m of the gate center. The 0.50 m body plus configured side margins
requires 0.74 m. It reached x = 12.03 m with no stop or body contact. The demo uses a disclosed 2.5 m local
obstacle horizon. Synchronized
[telemetry](docs/media/bac_gazebo_adaptive_clearance_telemetry.csv),
[9 machine-readable checks and input hashes](docs/media/bac_gazebo_adaptive_clearance_evidence.json), and the
[reproduction harness](examples/gazebo/README.md) accompany the video.

The replay supports only its selected matched run and aggregate annotation. The single BAC Gazebo run is
qualitative integration evidence, not an independent trial, physical-robot evidence, or safety validation.

## Position in Nav2

BAC selects the next `(v,w)` from the plan, local obstacles, and current velocity, including locally departing
from the path when needed. Its primary Nav2 integration point is therefore a Controller Server plugin.

```text
Planner → BAC / DWB / MPPI → Velocity Smoother → Collision Monitor → base
```

Collision Monitor is an independent final-stage stop/slowdown layer, not a replacement for BAC. To use BAC only
in narrow passages, register multiple controllers and select among them with a behavior-tree ControllerSelector
or equivalent application logic. See the [Nav2 integration guide](docs/en/nav2_integration.md) for the distinction
between BAC, a costmap layer, a DWB critic, Collision Monitor, and `bac_filter_node`.

## Quick start

Resolve the ROS 2 and Nav2 dependencies, then build the package in a colcon workspace:

```bash
cd /path/to/colcon_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select bilateral_arc_clearance_controller
colcon test --packages-select bilateral_arc_clearance_controller
colcon test-result --verbose
```

The package builds on ROS 2 Lyrical (Nav2 1.5) and ROS 2 Jazzy (Nav2 1.3); CI
runs both. The Nav2 controller interface changed between them, and the build
selects the right one from the installed `nav2_core` version. Kilted (Nav2
1.4) shares the Jazzy interface and is expected to build, but is not part of
CI.

For the same clean ROS 2 / Nav2 build used by CI, including the controller
plugin and ROS adapter tests, use the Docker verification environment:

```bash
./docker/nav2/verify.sh            # ROS 2 Lyrical
./docker/nav2/verify.sh jazzy      # ROS 2 Jazzy
```

See [ROS 2 Lyrical and Jazzy / Nav2 build verification](docker/nav2/README.md)
for details. It mounts the checkout read-only and leaves build artifacts inside
the temporary container.

Minimal configuration follows. Adjust the footprint, braking capability, and rear sensor coverage for the robot.
Installable examples are provided for
[differential drive](config/bac_controller.yaml) and
[Ackermann steering](config/bac_controller_ackermann.yaml), and
[holonomic drive](config/bac_controller_omni.yaml).

```yaml
controller_server:
  ros__parameters:
    controller_frequency: 20.0
    controller_plugins: ["FollowPath"]
    FollowPath:
      plugin: "bac::BacController"
      motion_model.type: diff_drive
      scan_topic: /scan
      footprint.front: 0.5
      footprint.rear: -0.5
      footprint.width: 0.95
      limits.v_max: 0.4
      limits.v_min: 0.0  # Use a negative value only with adequate rear sensing
      stop_decel: 0.8
```

The core and closed-loop scenarios can also be tested without ROS:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The 17 differential-drive closed-loop scenarios include LiDAR ray casting, an acceleration-limited actuator,
and unicycle kinematics. A separate 13-scenario Ackermann regression, and a 17-scenario holonomic one, drive a plant whose speed is
acceleration-limited and whose curvature slews at a bounded rate, so the commands are checked against a vehicle
that cannot change its steering instantly. It includes the shipped example configuration, so the file users copy
is the file the suite defends.

```bash
./build/bac_scenario_harness --strict --csv-dir traces
python3 test/plot_traces.py --dir traces
```

### Lateral/rear-goal regression tests

Goal-direction coverage includes a distant lateral control, a nearby lateral goal, a goal directly behind, and
a rear goal with an obstacle that makes in-place rotation inadmissible.

```bash
ctest --test-dir build -R BacGoalDirectionRegression --output-on-failure

./build/bac_scenario_harness --strict --csv-dir traces --filter goal_lateral_near
./build/bac_scenario_harness --strict --csv-dir traces --filter goal_behind
python3 test/plot_traces.py --dir traces goal_lateral_near goal_behind
```

In the current deterministic simulation, with reverse disabled for the front-sensor cases, the controller
reaches the goal 0.5 m to the left in 8.250 seconds, the goal 4.0 m directly behind in 18.700 seconds after an
in-place turn, and the 4.0 m lateral control in 13.050 seconds. When a side obstacle blocks the in-place sweep,
the explicitly enabled -0.1 m/s reverse floor
produces 52 reverse ticks before alignment and reaches the rear goal in 21.150 seconds. The 60-second check has
no collision or continuous stationary run.

Candidate selection uses signed progress on the ordered path and the path tangent relative to the body, not
collision admissibility alone. A hysteretic alignment mode handles nearby lateral and nearly rearward paths;
when rotation is unsafe, a goal-progressing reverse candidate is the fallback. All four scenarios and the CTest
command above must pass as regression acceptance criteria.

## Integration pitfalls

Collected while adopting BAC on a differential-drive outdoor robot with four
depth cameras. None of these produce an error message; each presents as the
controller behaving oddly.

### Hand the controller a real current velocity

BAC samples forward speeds in an acceleration-limited window around the velocity
Nav2 passes to `computeVelocityCommands`, that is `current.v ± acc_v *
window_time`. `controller_server` takes that velocity from its odometry
smoother, whose `odom_topic` parameter **defaults to `odom`**. If nothing
publishes that topic the smoother reports zero every cycle, so BAC can never
offer more than `acc_v * window_time` — 0.1 m/s with `acc_v: 0.4` and the
default `window_time: 0.25` — and, still being told it is stationary, never can
again.

The symptom is a robot that plans, steers and avoids correctly while driving at
a fixed fraction of `limits.v_max`, with nothing logged anywhere. Set the
parameter on `controller_server` itself; setting it on `bt_navigator` is a
different subscriber.

```yaml
controller_server:
  ros__parameters:
    odom_topic: /odometry/filtered   # whatever actually publishes nav_msgs/Odometry
```

Naming a topic that exists is only half of it. `OdomSmoother` reads
`twist.twist` and ignores `pose` entirely, so a publisher that fills in the pose
and leaves the twist at zero — not unusual — produces exactly the same failure
with the subscription connected and no warning to show for it. For a
differential-drive robot `twist.twist.linear.x` and `twist.twist.angular.z` have
to carry the real body velocity, in `child_frame_id` as the message specifies.
`ros2 topic echo` on the topic while the robot drives is the whole check.

With the usual `ros2_control` stack the content is not the problem: both
`diff_drive_controller` and `robot_localization`'s `ekf_node` publish a properly
filled twist. The *name* is. `diff_drive_controller` publishes on `~/odom`,
which is `/diff_drive_controller/odom` for a controller of that name, and Nav2
defaults to `odom`. Either point `odom_topic` at the real name or remap the
controller's output to `/odom`; a configuration that does neither is the one
that fails silently. Where a filter sits between the wheels and Nav2, give Nav2
the filtered estimate, so that the velocity it plans against and the
`odom -> base_link` transform it localizes against come from the same source.

### Make `control_period` match the rate the controller really achieves

`control_period` converts `acc_v` and `acc_w` into a per-cycle step, and the arc
rollouts assume commands are reissued that often. A stack declaring
`controller_frequency: 20.0` that achieves 6 Hz — easily done with several depth
cameras feeding a voxel layer — travels three times further between decisions
than the parameters imply, and margins tuned at the nominal rate are optimistic.
Nav2 reports it:

```text
Control loop missed its desired rate of 20.0000 Hz. Current loop rate is 6.4103
```

Fix the rate, or lower `limits.v_max` to match the rate you actually get.

### `avoid_margin.side` is an aspiration; `safety_margin.side` is the limit

Widening `avoid_margin.side` for comfort around pedestrians does not close
narrow passages: the aspiration adapts to the clearance the surroundings
actually afford, so a corridor narrower than the aspiration is still traversed,
centred. It does affect cruising speed, because the same tightness measure
moderates the speed cap toward `tight_cruise_fraction` (floored at
`creep_fraction`) — a wide aspiration in a consistently tight environment is a
slower one by design. `safety_margin.side` is the hard constraint, and it is the
one to check against the narrowest gap on the course.

### Reverse is an escape move, not a driving mode

Reverse candidates require `limits.v_min < 0`, are offered only when reverse is
reachable within one acceleration step (so, near standstill), and are kept only
when no safe forward candidate advances the ordered path. Expect them when the
robot is genuinely stuck. A route that needs several metres of reversing in the
open is not what this provides.

### Read the diagnostics before theorising

With `diagnostics_publish_period` above zero, BAC publishes `obstacle_source`,
`scan_state`, `bac_status`, `candidate_count`, `admissible_count`,
`best_clearance_m`, `nearest_distance_m` and `best_path_cost_m` on
`/diagnostics`. They separate cases that look identical from outside:

- `candidate_count` and `admissible_count` both zero: BAC has no move at all,
  usually because the robot is already inside its own margins.
- `admissible_count` healthy while the command stays zero: the scoring chose to
  stop or rotate. `best_path_cost_m` shows whether any candidate was making
  progress.
- `obstacle_source` says whether the raw scan or the costmap fallback is in use,
  which is worth checking before blaming the controller for what it was shown.

### Keep the robot's own structure out of the obstacle input

Cameras mounted on the deck see the chassis along the bottom of every frame.
Those returns become obstacles at zero range that travel with the robot, and the
clearance terms then never let it move. Crop the image band and subtract the
robot's own volume from the cloud — a negative `CropBox` in `base_link` — before
the costmap or scan reaches BAC. Keep that box tight to the chassis: whatever it
removes is invisible to the controller, so an over-wide box quietly deletes real
obstacles just in front of the bumper.

## Limitations

- BAC supports 2D differential-drive, Ackermann, and holonomic vehicles as constant body motions. Under the
  holonomic model the body still travels on an arc, with a constant offset between the direction of travel and
  where the body points.
- In Ackermann mode, the Nav2 command remains body forward speed plus yaw rate, and the vehicle model is a single
  minimum turning radius — the same granularity as the `AckermannConstraints` of Nav2 MPPI. The downstream vehicle
  controller must map the twist to road-wheel steering, for example
  `delta = atan(wheelbase * angular.z / linear.x)`. BAC does not model wheelbase, road-wheel angle, or steering
  rate, and does not read measured steering-joint feedback.
- A forward-only ACKERMANN configuration (`limits.v_min = 0`) cannot reach a goal behind the vehicle. BAC brakes
  instead of fabricating a spin and leaves the multi-point turn to a Nav2 recovery. Differential drive solves it
  by rotating on the spot - `test/scenarios.cpp`'s `goal_behind` runs exactly that configuration - and the
  holonomic model reaches it by translating.
- Only the holonomic model honours the goal ORIENTATION Nav2 carries on the last plan pose. `diff_drive` and
  `ackermann` steer with yaw and cannot choose their orientation independently of their direction of travel, so
  they follow the path tangent instead. The holonomic model can go further: `plan_yaw_mode: "plan"` hands the
  orientation of the whole journey to the plan's pose orientations (see
  [docs/en/nav2_integration.md](docs/en/nav2_integration.md)).
- Holonomic lateral motion presumes sensor coverage abeam the body. A front-only lidar cannot see where a
  crabbing robot is going.
- It does not estimate obstacle velocity or future obstacle positions.
- The output yaw rate is limited to a value reachable after one control cycle, but swept motion during the
  corresponding angular-acceleration or steering transient and jerk have not been evaluated.
- Enable reverse motion only when rear sensor coverage is adequate.
- A raw-scan failure falls back to the costmap. Configure an independent layer such as Collision Monitor when
  fail-stop behavior is required.
- Version 0.1.0 is evaluated primarily in simulation. Ackermann coverage currently consists of deterministic
  closed-loop tests, not physical-vehicle evidence. Physical latency, slip, outliers, steering tracking, and
  control-period overruns require separate validation.
