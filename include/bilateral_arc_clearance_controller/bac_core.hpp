 * @brief Framework-free core of the arc-clearance local planner
 * @date 2026-08-26
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2026 Masaaki Hijikata
 *
 * Self-contained C++17 library: no ROS, no shm, no project-specific headers.
 * Inputs are obstacle points and a LOCAL PATH, both in the robot frame, plus
 * the current velocity; output is the next (v, w) command.
 *
 * The differential-drive policy derives from Dynamic Window Approach candidate
 * sampling; the Ackermann policy samples body curvature bounded by
 * turn_radius_min, at the granularity of the Nav2 MPPI AckermannConstraints.
 * In both cases, traversability evaluation uses the bilateral arc clearance
 * measure: candidate velocities are sampled from an acceleration-limited
 * translational window and the configured steering range, rolled out as
 * constant-curvature arcs, and scored by
 *   saturated bilateral clearance + local-goal following (distance / heading)
 *   - hysteresis - lateral squeeze,
 * with DWA admissibility (can the robot stop before the first body hit on the
 * arc) and an emergency-stop layer in front of everything.
 *
 * v1 of this core took an upper-level velocity command (v, w) as the intent.
 * That representation broke down under nav2: a feedback-type steering command
 * (pure pursuit) extrapolated as a persistent arc reads as infeasible in
 * corridors, collapsing the intent's weight. The intent is therefore a path.
 *
 * Wrapped by the nav2 controller plugin / cmd_vel filter node of this
 * package, or embeddable in any 20Hz-ish control loop. Behavior is verified
 * by the closed-loop scenario harness in test/.
